<h2>History Of artificial intelligence</h2>
<table style="width:100%">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1943</td>
    <td>Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity." The paper proposed the first mathematic model for building a neural network. </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>1949</td>
    <td>    In his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the theory that neural pathways are created from experiences and that connections between neurons become stronger the more frequently they're used. Hebbian learning continues to be an important model in AI.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="4">1959</td>
    <td> Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and J.C. Shaw develop the General Problem Solver (GPS), a program designed to imitate human problem-solving. 
     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Herbert Gelernter develops the Geometry Theorem Prover program.
      </td>

  <tr>
    <td>  Arthur Samuel coins the term machine learning while at IBM.
     </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td> John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky found the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1969</td>
    <td>  The first successful expert systems are developed in DENDRAL, a XX program, and MYCIN, designed to diagnose blood infections, are created at Stanford. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1980</td>
    <td>  igital Equipment Corporations develops R1 (also known as XCON), the first successful commercial expert system. Designed to configure orders for new computer systems, R1 kicks off an investment boom in expert systems that will last for much of the decade, effectively ending the first "AI Winter." </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">1987-1993</td>
    <td> As computing technology improved, cheaper alternatives emerged and the Lisp machine market collapsed in 1987, ushering in the "Second AI Winter." During this period, expert systems proved too expensive to maintain and update, eventually falling out of favor.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
       <td>  Japan terminates the FGCS project in 1992, citing failure in meeting the ambitious goals outlined a decade earlier. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>  DARPA ends the Strategic Computing Initiative in 1993 after spending nearly $1 billion and falling far short of expectations.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1997</td>
    <td>     IBM's Deep Blue beats world chess champion Gary Kasparov  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">2005</td>
    <td>   STANLEY, a self-driving car, wins the DARPA Grand Challenge.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>  The U.S. military begins investing in autonomous robots like Boston Dynamic's "Big Dog" and iRobot's "PackBot." </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>2008</td>
    <td>  Google makes breakthroughs in speech recognition and introduces the feature in its iPhone app.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2012</td>
    <td>  Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain Deep Learning project, feeds a neural network using deep learning algorithms 10 million YouTube videos as a training set. The neural network learned to recognize a cat without being told what a cat is, ushering in breakthrough era for neural networks and deep learning funding. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2014</td>
    <td>      Google makes first self-driving car to pass a state driving test.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2014</td>
    <td>       Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats world champion Go player Lee Sedol. The complexity of the ancient Chinese game was seen as a major hurdle to clear in AI.</td>
